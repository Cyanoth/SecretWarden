    -> Administrators can merge pull requests containing secrets (recommended)
    -> Verbose time taken logging.
    -> Use Alternative Merge Check Icon

    -> Rule set (table where administrator can edit)

    This will be readonly at project/repo level but writing at global config (add a fail safe to ADMIN permission)
